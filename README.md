This repo is made to display interactive graph of availability that depends on two parameters lambda and mu, but as well as plotly allows to create one slider - constaints will depend on parameters named as hour.

So lambda = 1-10/hours
mu = 1/hours

Here is an initial link to graph [a link](http://availability-graph.herokuapp.com/)
